# Hi, I'm Luqman Khailmi 👋

I am a Computer Science student at **Universiti Teknologi MARA** (Semester 4/7) with a focus on **Full-Stack Development**.  
I build web applications using **React, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Docker**.

I also have experience in **data analysis and dashboard management** using **Google Looker Studio**.  
Previously, I interned at **UiTM Global** under the Department of Strategic Partnership, where I monitored and managed international engagement data.
One of my work: [Dashboard PI081-PI084 2025](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/cbcad387-9d17-49fd-ba89-f703c959052a/page/p_uigisihsnd)

Currently, I am working on **Monitor** and **Circles** (pinned below) to further enhance my technical skills and practical experience.
